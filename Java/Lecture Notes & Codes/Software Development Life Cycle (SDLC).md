# Software Development Lifecycle

- Planning
- Requirement Analysis
- Design
- Implementation / Coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

— Customer has the idea and money to fund for the invoice application.

— Reaches out to different tech companies to see what they like then meet with company owner for agreement.

## Planning Requirements

— Customer and company owner discuss what are the planning requirements for the application they want to make.

For example:

- User Registration
- Login
- Logout
- Dashboard

— During this process, new features will be added in the future.

## Requirement Analysis

— Meeting occurs with developers, operations, and product owners.

— Outline the requirements and plan in details

For example: Requirement 1

- Username Input Field
- Password Input Field
- Checkbox - Accept Terms & Conditions
- Submit Button
- Save User Info to Database

— Product owner then take all of the information and turn them into tickets in a project management systems

## Design

— Takes all the requirements and starts to plan the product.

For example:

- What programming languages to use
- What user interface layout to use
- Business rules
- Color Schemes
- Frameworks
- System server designs
- Database relationships
- Mobile aspects
- Supported Browsers

## Implementation / Coding

- Operations team set up the physical hardware for the server
- Developers start writing the code
- Designers still design all the user interface
- Testers analyze the requirements to build test cases

## Testing (Most Important)

— Testers test the application using the test cases from previous to find all the bugs and confirm that everything works.

— Testers report bugs to a tracking system where developers then fix the bug.

## Deployment

— Operations team stages all products, setting them all up for deployment.

— After all is set up, the application goes live to users. 

— While live, and the application is popular, then maintenance is done to keep the servers up and running.

## Maintenance

— Users use production support by sending emails so that they can stop and investigate the issues and resolve it.

— In future, new features will be added and the cycle begins again.
