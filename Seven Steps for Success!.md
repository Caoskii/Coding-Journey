# Seven Steps for Success

## 1. Realize the Time Commitment

— College computer courses are often listed in a catalog of courses with both lecture and lab hours, but unlike the natural and biological sciences (chemistry, physics and biology), students can usually complete their lab portions at a variety of locations. 

— The normal rule of thumb is to study 2 - 2.5 hours out of class studying for every hour in class that means for both lab and lecture hours.

## 2. Understand Your Capacity to Concentrate

— You cannot spend long periods of time working on computer course materials. After4 - 6 hours, the ability to learn drop significantly close to near zero. Understand what you need.

## 3. Plan Regular Study Times

— Combination of time commitment and ability to concentrate leads to the conclusion that you cannot cram weeks of study time into a week-end of concentrated study. Successful students break up their study time to 3 - 4 hr study periods, spread over the entire week. Must establish a regular routine for each week.

— Pace yourself with multiple study times allows for effective learning. Do not procrastinate, cramming through course materials are rarely “A” students.

## 4. Learning Requires Variety and Repetition

— Completing a variety of activities related to one topic helps the brain understand and build memory. Repetition (exposure over multiple study periods) is essential for our brain to learn and recall course materials. (Understand item A before learning item B)

— Textbooks and professors break-up course materials into chapters, topics or learning modules. Read the learning objectives first then review items at the end of each unit. **Rushing through an assignment for completion is NOT studying. Reviewing the material more than once is STUDYING.**

- Do you understand each learning objectives?
- if you did not understand the reading materials, did you re-read it?
- Did you consider using 3x5 cards to study definitions and vocabulary?
- Did you take notes and do you have them stored in a organized notebook?
- Are there any learning activities (tasks or assignments) available, and if yes, did you do them?
- Did you review the learning objectives before taking any quizzes?
- If the quizzes are computerized, did you study your quiz results?
- **After reviewing quiz results, did you review material and retake the. quiz again, if available?**
- **After reviewing assignment results, did you try to redo the assignment (even if you could not submit it for another grade)?**

— Purpose of a quiz is to self-assess your understanding of the material. **Change or modify your learning habits if learning is not complete.**

## 5. Interact with the Other Students

— Private interactions with instructor is not participating in the course. Interacting with other students and forming study groups are essential to the learning process.

## 6. Don’t Procrastinate and Don’t Get Behind

— Plan regular study periods to catch up if left behind. Plan to do extra study to catch up and modify study habits to avoid this in the future. (i.e Social Media break, Pomodoro Technique)

## 7. Attend Class and Take Notes

— Take lecture notes and review those later when studying to provide the necessary information needed for material. Writing notes actively engages the brain. Arrange study groups to take and share notes if one is absent. **Announcements and exam date changes, hints on exam questions should be all written down.**

— If taking a distance education course, must regularly enter the learning management system to review the announcements, discussion list postings and emails. Professors will assume everything they communicated via tools will be read by students within 3 days. **You are responsible for reading the items and completing any action requested.**
